            <h2>SlumberPal: Sleep tracking app with plush toy companion</h2>
            <p>
                For our final project in HCDE 451, we created SlumberPal, a sleep tracking app featuring a plush toy companion 
                that allows parents to monitor their children's sleep patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
                The toy uses motion (and sound) sensors to determine when a child is asleep and analyze sleep stages throughout 
                the night. This information is relayed to the child's parent(s) through the app, providing essential data to keep 
                them informed about their child's health.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the toy is designed to enhance a child's sleep experience with calming aromatherapy and white noise. 
                While the sleep tracker is more suitable for toddlers and older children with consistent sleep patterns, the soothing 
                features are appropriate for children of all ages, including infants.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project comprises four prototyping techniques–paper, digital, textile, and video prototyping. This process log 
                will detail each prototyping technique, outlining the goals, implementation methods, and the subsequent evaluation and 
                analysis of each.

        <div class="project-section" id="inspiration">
            <h4>Our inspiration</h4>
            <h2>Fostering healthy sleep habits for children's wellbeing</h2>
            <p>
                Inspired by the UN's third goal for sustainable development of Good Health and Wellbeing, this project aims to 
                foster healthy lifestyles for all, beginning with the youngest members of our community. Adequate but also restful 
                sleep is crucial for a child's growth, cognitive development, and emotional wellbeing.

        <div class="project-section" id="paper-prototype">
            <h4>Paper Prototype</h4>
            
            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <p>
                We started with a paper prototype for the app component, with the intent to gather feedback and make rapid iterations 
                before committing to a higher fidelity prototype.
            </p>
            <p>
                This initial prototype was shaped by findings from background research on other sleep tracking apps. Our exploration 
                of these apps revealed common features and functionalities that users found valuable, such as graphical representations 
                of sleep patterns, daily mood journals, and customizable sleep settings.
            </p>
            <img src="images/slumberpal_images/Appscreen2.webp" alt="SlumberPal app screen" loading="lazy">
            
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>
                Our purpose in creating the paper prototype was to gather preliminary data on the desirability and usability of the 
                features that we, through research, chose to include in our own app product.
            </p>
            <p>
                We wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of each feature, identify potential improvements, and examine how users interacted 
                with or perceived our app's overall functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                The insights gained from this prototype could then be used to guide us in refining and enhancing features for our next 
                prototype, a digital prototype in slightly higher fidelity.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <img src="images/slumberpal_images/design_sketches.webp" alt="Initial design sketches for the paper prototype" loading="lazy">
            <p>
                We chose to focus on the design of four screens associated with key user flows for the app:
            </p>
            <ul style="color: #333333; line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem; font-size: 1rem;">
                <li><strong>Tracking/tracking history</strong>—to view previous tracking history along with important stats such as sleep score, sleep stages, wake up times, and time spent sleeping</li>
                <li><strong>Sound control</strong>—to adjust the type and volume of sound emitted from the toy throughout the night</li>
                <li><strong>Scheduling</strong>—to set the time for the toy to track the child's sleep or an alarm to wake up the child</li>
                <li><strong>Mood journal</strong>—to keep track of noteworthy changes in the child's mood or behavior, potentially related to sleep quality</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We transferred all digital sketches onto paper and cut them to scale to simulate realism for subsequent user testing.
            </p>

            <h3>Evaluation</h3>
            <p>
                To evaluate this prototype for our goals of desirability and usability, we conducted user testing. This involved asking 
                our test user to accomplish tasks related to each feature while thinking aloud, and following up with questions to gauge 
                the ease of task execution. We took note of when the user was not able to identify the function or meaning of an icon or 
                component, in order to rework it for the next prototype.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                After the user testing of our prototype, we discovered a few aspects of the prototype that worked well:
            </p>
            <ul style="color: #333333; line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-size: 1rem;">
                <li>Broad spectrum of information—from sleep duration to quality</li>
                <li>Mood emoticons—visually entertaining, effective in conveying emotion without the need for words</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                However, there was much to be improved as well, including:
            </p>
            <ul style="color: #333333; line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem; font-size: 1rem;">
                <li>Confusing icons—nav bar icons are not standard to other apps, reducing user familiarity</li>
                <li>Continuous sleep graph—more intuitive for sleep stages to be graphed as discrete rather than continuous</li>
                <li>Manual text entry—overly complicates the journal feature</li>
                <li>Lack of home screen—unclear what the main feature of the app is</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If we were to make another paper prototype, we might prioritize navigation, reducing the emphasis on individual features 
                in order to further refine the user journey and craft a more seamless interactive experience with the app.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section" id="digital-prototype">
            <h4>Digital Prototype</h4>
            
            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <p>
                After creating a paper prototype, we moved on to a low fidelity digital prototype of the SlumberPal sleep tracking app and 
                focused on clarifying aspects of our paper prototype that were confusing during user testing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Features of the digital prototype consisted of a clear home screen with a visual of the previous night's sleep score and 
                timeline, a sleep history page to view trends in sleep quality, a mood journal to track alongside sleep trends, and a 
                sleep schedule to set tracking time and desired ambient sounds to accompany the child's sleep.
            </p>
            <img src="images/slumberpal_images/App_wireframes.png" alt="SlumberPal digital prototype wireframes" loading="lazy">
            
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of the digital prototype was to evaluate desirability of the app's various features and interactive elements, 
                along with more effectively evaluating usability compared to the paper prototype.
            </p>
            <p>
                We wanted to see if users would find the features we designed desirable and easy to use, and verify that the overall flow 
                of the app prototype was simple and intuitive. Because we started with a paper prototype, we developed a solid understanding 
                of what did and didn't work, and used that to guide a better, more detailed iteration of the app to be tested and evaluated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from our evaluation goals, this prototype was necessary for demonstration in our video prototype. We decided a lo-fi 
                digital prototype would be adequate for communicating a use case for the app in a short video scenario because it looks 
                cleaner and more realistic than a paper prototype but still fits our time constraints.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>
                We created an interactive digital prototype in Figma, with key features like:
            </p>
            <ul style="color: #333333; line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem; font-size: 1rem;">
                <li><strong>Home</strong> — Displays a timeline visualizing the previous night's sleep, which is broken down into the various 
                sleep stages so users can quickly scan the data for sleep and wake times. Also includes an overall sleep quality score.</li>
                <li><strong>Sleep History</strong> — Accessed via nav bar. Consists of a line graph depicting sleep score history, with 
                adjustable time range, for users interested in trends over longer periods of time.</li>
                <li><strong>Mood Journal</strong> — Accessed via nav bar. A space for users to track the factors that influence, or are 
                influenced, by sleep, such as activity, stress, and wake-up mood.</li>
                <li><strong>Sleep Schedule</strong> — Accessed via nav bar. Where users can set a tracking schedule for the SlumberPal plushie 
                and select the ambient sounds that it will play, such as rain or white noise.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Evaluation</h3>
            <p>
                To evaluate the effectiveness of this prototype in satisfying our goals of desirability and usability, we recruited a 
                participant to test the app. We let this user explore the app with little guidance except for some initial context on the 
                purpose of the app. This allowed us to see how intuitive and easy-to-use the app is. After giving the user time to explore 
                the app, we conducted a short post-session interview asking them for their thoughts on various aspects of the app, including 
                iconography, the general flow of the app, and more.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Our user testing provided a lot of valuable feedback on this prototype. Some things that worked well for our test user were:
            </p>
            <ul style="color: #333333; line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-size: 1rem;">
                <li>Clear iconography for the mood journal</li>
                <li>An intuitive sleep schedule screen</li>
                <li>A clear understanding of the overall purpose and uses of the app</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Compared to our feedback on the paper prototype, this prototype featured more consistency in its design, had a clearly-defined 
                home screen, and had clearer iconography overall. However, there were still several areas of improvement that our user raised, 
                including:
            </p>
            <ul style="color: #333333; line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem; font-size: 1rem;">
                <li>The moon icon for the sleep history page — thought the icon would take them to sleep history, not sleep schedule</li>
                <li>Redundancy between home screen and nav bar buttons</li>
                <li>More detail on the home screen — suggested that we add sleep history to the home screen to reduce the effort of navigating 
                to a separate page</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                With this feedback in mind, we would continue to iterate on the home page, making it a more effective, efficient display that 
                contains core information that users want to be able to quickly, and frequently, access. We would also make some small 
                adjustments to the iconography of the app to improve usability.
            </p>

            <h4>Textile Prototype</h4>
            
            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <p>
                Once we made sufficient progress with the app prototypes, we shifted gears to work on the plushie that the child would 
                hold to sleep. We aimed to create two iterations for a toy bear with the most comforting, cuddle-friendly design.
            </p>
            <img src="images/slumberpal_images/physical_sketches.webp" alt="Pattern sketches for the plushie (F—front, B—back)" loading="lazy">
            
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>
                For both prototype iterations, the goal was to evaluate the desirability of the toy's physical form and materials, as well 
                as the feasibility of incorporating additional components like scent and sound functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                We wanted the look and feel of the toy to appeal to children, regardless of age or gender, and help establish a positive, 
                enjoyable association with their sleep environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like the digital prototype, this prototype was also necessary for our video prototype to showcase its integration into the 
                overall user experience. As such, we worked on refining not only the physical aspects of the toy but also its interactive elements.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>
                We first sketched out the pattern for each piece of the plushie. There were four pieces total, including two front pieces 
                and two back pieces. We then cut the fabric and sewed everything together using a sewing machine.
            </p>
            <img src="images/slumberpal_images/physcial_sketch1.webp" alt="Initial design sketches for the textile prototype" loading="lazy">
            <p>
                The first iteration was made out of pink felt with a safety pin closure at the back, while the second iteration was made 
                with purple fleece and a velcro closure. The second iteration was scaled up in size by approximately 1.5 times.
            </p>
            <img src="images/slumberpal_images/front_physical.gif" alt="Textile prototype front view" loading="lazy">
            <img src="images/slumberpal_images/back_physical.gif" alt="Textile prototype back view" loading="lazy">
            <p>
                Both iterations included a small styrofoam cube, representing a speaker, and a scented tea bag. The first iteration used a rooibos tea bag, 
                but the second iteration used a jasmine tea bag. A cardboard rectangle on the second iteration was also meant to represent 
                a sleep sensor.
            </p>
            <img src="images/slumberpal_images/physical_open.gif" alt="Textile prototype with speaker and tea bag" loading="lazy">
            
            <h3>Evaluation</h3>
            <p>
                The evaluation of the prototype's desirability was focused on getting feedback on the aesthetics and tactile qualities of the 
                toy. We gave a test user the toy to examine closely, and asked them for their impressions of its size, shape, and texture, 
                along with whether or not they could see themselves comfortably holding it to sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
                The feasibility assessment factored in the practical aspects of incorporating scent and sound features into the toy. We asked 
                the test user to perform the action of adding the speaker and tea bag into the toy through the velcro opening in the back and 
                then describe the ease of the task. We also had them sniff the toy and comment on the strength and calming properties of the scent.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Here is general feedback we received on the first iteration of the prototype, which we used to improve the design of our 
                second prototype:
            </p>
            <ul style="color: #333333; line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-size: 1rem;">
                <li>The size is too small for holding and carrying the internal components</li>
                <li>The felt makes the plushie feel firm and slightly rough to the touch</li>
                <li>The scent is a little astringent, which makes it less relaxing to smell</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When we tested our second prototype, the feedback was much more positive. Specifically, what worked well was:
            </p>
            <ul style="color: #333333; line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-size: 1rem;">
                <li>Scaling up in size—made it easier to hold and much more plush</li>
                <li>Selecting a material more neutral in color and blanket-like in terms of feel</li>
                <li>Adding a velcro closure—compared to a safety pin, it felt more secure and user friendly</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                However, there were still several potential areas of improvement, including:
            </p>
            <ul style="color: #333333; line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem; font-size: 1rem;">
                <li>Scent strength—expected the scent to waft out without having to inhale into it</li>
                <li>Lack of an internal (lined) pocket for the speaker and tea bag</li>
                <li>Method of attaching velcro—suggested the velcro be sewed on, instead of stuck on using adhesive</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If there were to be a next iteration, we would work on making adjustments to the closures and internal elements of the plushie, 
                since we didn't have time to address those aspects thoroughly in the second iteration, and they came up as problem areas in 
                feedback sessions.
            </p>

        <div class="project-section" id="video-prototype">
            <h4>Video Prototype</h4>
            
            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <p>
                To close out the project, we thought a video prototype could be used to present a key use case for the SlumberPal product 
                and demonstrate the prototypes for the toy and app working together in tandem.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scenario we chose was: A parent is concerned about their child's unusual sleeping habits and uses the app to check their 
                sleep quality. When they see that their child is sleeping poorly, they add an aromatherapy pouch to the toy to aid their sleep. 
                The next morning, the parent checks the app again to find that their sleep score has improved.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>
                The goal for the video prototype was primarily to assess the desirability and impact of our project's concept and execution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Specifically, we aimed to measure the emotional response of our audience to a scenario designed to be relatable and show off 
                the functionality of our product in a real-world context. Through the video, we sought to answer the question: "Is our product 
                really providing a practical solution to a common concern among our target users?"
            </p>
            
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>
                The first step in our process was to draft storyboards according to the scenario of our video. Once our storyboards were 
                established, with each frame corresponding to a shot, we could begin filming and editing shots together.
            </p>
            <img src="images/slumberpal_images/storyboard1.webp" alt="Storyboard sketches for the video prototype (1)" loading="lazy">
            <img src="images/slumberpal_images/storyboard2.webp" alt="Storyboard sketches for the video prototype (2)" loading="lazy">
            <p>
                For filming, we made sure to have at least two people, one actor and one cameraman, so we could get the right distance and 
                camera angles with limited equipment. Another person was in charge of editing in CapCut, where we added transitions and made 
                trims wherever necessary.

            <h3>Evaluation</h3>
            <p>
                To evaluate this prototype with desirability and impact in mind, we played the video for a test user with minimal context, 
                observing their facial expressions and noting any verbal commentary to capture their authentic reactions. We then prompted the 
                user to describe, in their own words, what they perceived the product to be and what they felt watching the video.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the second phase of our evaluation, we provided the user with a more detailed explanation of the product and asked them to 
                rewatch the video. We asked them to pinpoint moments where our messaging was either clear or unclear to gather insights into 
                their interpretation and understanding of the video's content.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                From our user testing, these are the aspects of our video that worked well:
            </p>
            <ul style="color: #333333; line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-size: 1rem;">
                <li>Text transition slides—helped with understanding the narrative</li>
                <li>Close-ups of app frames—highlighted the improvement in sleep score/quality</li>
                <li>Clear and straightforward sequence of events</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These are the aspects that could use improvement:
            </p>
            <ul style="color: #333333; line-height: 1.8; margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem; font-size: 1rem;">
                <li>Color use in the app prototype—lack of color takes away from app's desirability</li>
                <li>Shot lighting—some shots are really dark, making it hard to see what's going on</li>
                <li>Depictions of toy functionality—almost seems like the toy is a sleep aid rather than a sleep tracker</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If we could have done something differently in the process of creating this prototype, we would have recruited an actual child 
                to act in the video to be able to expand on our scenario and add more shot variety.

            <h2>Refining the product through iterative prototyping</h2>
            <p>
                Through the course of several iterations and test sessions, our team was able to make informed decisions about the design
